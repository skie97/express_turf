# Express TURF!

Simple Express service to intersect sightings of a contact of interest.
Uses turf.js to do the computations.

## To Use

The main function is getIntersections.
To pass in an array of objects conforming to the sightingsData
The anticipation is that there are sightings data that are each timestamped, with it's own degreeOfUncertainty
based on the sensor performance, and an anticipated average speed the COI is moving.

## TODO:

Complete Test Functions for 
- buffer function
- intersect

## History
 
Version 0.1 (2024-06-01) - added basic functions to interestSightings.
